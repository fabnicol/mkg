# Options file

# This files contains specifications of command line
# It is effectively parsed by the bash script mkgentoo.sh for othe options than help(=md)
# It is read by scripts and should be kept read-only
# All fields should be double-quoted
# Blank space is free as well as # comments
# Do not use more than just one line per option (no inlined breaks)
# 4 columns are used.
# Type is in:"b", "f", "d", "o", "u", "s", "n", "e", "vm" (see Doxygen Doc)
# Conditional type is of the form "x:y":  [ -z "$x" ] <=> { [ "$y" = "false" ] ||  [ -z "$y" ]; } && [ "$y" != "true" ]
# debug_mode and verbose should be placed on top so that they are set by default earlier in function test_cli()
# dep is a reserved word for dummy defaults of dependencies i.e. optional strings that may remain unspecified.
# Note: to facilitate help output, use ` `, not $()
